# 🤖 AI Template Creation Guide: The Fast Workflow

This guide outlines the most efficient way to add new, professional templates to Resumy using AI. By leveraging **Claude 4.6 Sonnet** (or the latest available version), you can convert a visual design into a fully-functional, paginated React template in minutes.

## 🚀 Step 1: Register the Template
Before generating code, you need a placeholder for your new template.

1.  **Create a Folder**: Navigate to `frontend/app/resume-creator/templates/`.
2.  **Naming**: Create a new folder named after your template (e.g., `ModernSleek`).
3.  **Create JSX**: Inside that folder, create a file named `TemplateName.jsx`.
4.  **Register**: Open `TemplateRegistry.js` and add your new template to the list so the system recognizes it.

## 🧠 Step 2: AI Prompting Strategy
For the best results, use **Claude.ai** (Web Interface). It excels at maintaining logic across large React components.

### What to Prepare:
1.  **Visual Reference**: An image of the template you want to build.
2.  **Logic Reference**: Copy the code of an existing template that has a similar structure.
    *   *If you want a 1-column template*, copy `ClassicExecutive.jsx`.
    *   *If you want a 2-column sidebar template*, copy `AzureModern.jsx`.

### The Master Prompt:
Upload the **image** and attach the **reference code**, then use this prompt for the best results:

> "Act as a Senior React Developer specializing in high-fidelity PDF/Web rendering. Your task is to build a new resume template named **[YourTemplateName]** that **looks exactly like the attached image** but **functions exactly like the attached reference code**.
> 
> **1. STRUCTURE & LOGIC:**
> - Use the **exact same logic** for pagination, section breaking, and continuation as the reference code. 
> - Maintain the `PaginatedCanvas` and section mapping architecture.
> - Ensure the layout (One-column or Two-column) mirrors the logic of the reference (e.g., how sections are distributed between main and sidebar).
> 
> **2. STYLING & DESIGN SETTINGS:**
> - Implement the visual aesthetics from the image using clean, scoped CSS.
> - **REQUIRED DYNAMIC STYLES**: You must use the `style` prop for:
>   - `style.primaryColor` (Headers, accents, icons)
>   - `style.textColor` (Body text)
>   - `style.sectionSpacing` (Margin/padding between major sections)
>   - `style.paraSpacing` (Margin/padding between list items/paragraphs)
>   - `style.fontFamily` (Apply to the root of the template)
> 
> **3. ROBUSTNESS & CONTENT:**
> - Handle empty sections gracefully (if `data.experience` is empty, don't render the header).
> - Ensure `page-break-inside: avoid` is applied correctly to entries within sections to prevent cut-off text.
> - Support every section: Personal Info, Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Languages, and Certifications.
> 
> **4. OUTPUT:**
> Provide the **complete, sanitized code** in a single file ready to be pasted into the JSX file. Do not omit any boilerplate or imports."

## 🛠️ Step 3: Copy and Implement
Once Claude generates the code:
1.  Copy the code.
2.  Paste it into the empty JSX file you created in Step 1.
3.  Check for any missing imports or obvious syntax errors.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Sanitize & Polish (Auditing)
Every template must follow strict rendering rules. Run the built-in audit scripts to ensure your template won't break on export or multi-page resumes.

Go to the `frontend` directory and run:

### 1. Render Audit
Checks if the template breaks across pages correctly.
```bash
node scripts/render_audit.js --template=YourTemplateName
```

### 2. Field Audit
Ensures all data fields are mapped correctly and no data is lost.
```bash
node scripts/field_audit.js --template=YourTemplateName
```

## 🎨 Best Practices
*   **Recommended AI**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (or higher) is highly recommended over other models for its superior understanding of React component logic and layouts.
*   **Consistency**: Always use the reference code from an existing *working* template. This ensures you don't have to "reinvent the wheel" for the complex pagination logic.
*   **Variable Support**: Ensure your styles use the `style` prop passed to the component (e.g., `style.primaryColor`) so users can customize it in the editor.
